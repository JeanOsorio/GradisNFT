# Gradis NFT Generator

Welcome to the gradis, a collection of script-based generative animations forged randomly at mint and living forever within the Ethereum blockchain.

The script was designed to work with native Adobe After Effects vector animations rendered as .json files using Lottie; it allows vector animated combinations to be bound on the fly. Possibilities are endless. Feel free to build upon, build within and, of course, have fun with it.

## How to run this code
